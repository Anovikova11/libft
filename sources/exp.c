t them to unsigned char *

while both strings do not equal to NULL

iterate through both at the same time with same variable
and try to get to the end.
as long as the char in the strings are matching

if not
return the diffs between s1  - s2

if you manage to get to the end
return the difference as well between s1 - s2
